# The Digital Society

.pull-left[
More and more of our actions happen through digital technologies, e.g.:

- Searching for a job online   
- Talking with a family member over the phone  
- Sharing open source code  
- Posting a video on a social networking site  
- Paying at the supermarket with a credit card  
- Chatting with your boss on a company instant messenger

# The Digital Transformation

The growth in adoption and evolution of these technologies is the **digital transformation** of society, which has some consequences:

- **Datafication**: Digital technologies generate data traces that can persist and be analyzed 

- How individuals interact with digital technologies is based on the code of software running on them. The design of that code is based on **algorithms** that describe the rules of how the technology operates  

- Digital technologies might use data produce by humans in their algorithms, for example through machine learning **models** to personalize content or make predictions

## What are Computational Social Systems?

Systems in which humans and machines interact through Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). For example social media, mobile phone networks, programming collaboration platforms, enterprise resource planners, online videogames... 

.pull-left[
Computational social systems generate **new social phenomena** that did not exist before the digital transformation

Computational social systems produce **new data on human behavior** that is transforming the social and human sciences
