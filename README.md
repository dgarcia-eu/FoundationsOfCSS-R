# Foundations of Computational Social Systems
[David Garcia](http://dgarcia.eu), 2021

Welcome to the online materials for Foundations of Computational Social Systems.

The widespread use of information and communication technologies in our digital society motivates the study of Computational Social Systems, where humans and machines interact in a way that generates new phenomena and data traces. These new phenomena require an interdisciplinary approach that builds on digital trace data to study Computational Social Sytems at global scales, very high frequencies, and unprecedented levels of depth and resolution.

This course focuses on the fundamentals of a computational approach to study new social sytems in our digital society. Students in this course learn how to plan, execute, and interpret complete Data Science projects to address questions about human behavior and emergent phenomena in Computational Social Sytems. After this course, students will know how to gather data from social media, search trends, and other online and offline sources, how to process and store that data, and how to combine, analyze, and visualize data to address specific questions. The course makes a special emphasis in interpretation and critique of Data Science in the Social Sciences, aiming at an interdisciplinary approach rooted on the understanding of the power and limitations of online technologies for social interaction.

## Who am I?

I am the Professor for Computational Behavioral and Social Sciences the Graz University of Technology, where I lead the [Computational Social Science Lab](http://www.csslab.at). I am also group leader at the Medical University of Vienna and at the Complexity Science Hub Vienna. My background is Computer Science but I worked my whole career with psychologists, sociologists and physicists to learn new ways to understand human behavior. I got my PhD from ETH Zurich in 2012 and a habilitation in 2018, starting to work as full professor TU Graz in 2020. To learn more about my research, check my [publications](https://dgarcia.eu/full-publication-list/). I teach this course in collaboration with [Dr. Jana Lasser](https://janalasser.at/), a postdoctoral reasearcher in the Computational Social Science Lab.

## Course Contents

The course is organized in 13 sessions. Each session contains a practical part with exercises for you to apply what you learned. From the third week, the practice session will consist of a discussion of solutions to the exercise corresponding to the previous session. In exercises, you collect your own data and try to answer questions about human behavior and online phenomena. The online materials do not contain the solutions to the exercises, but if you are stuck or want to start from an easier point, in the github folder of the exercise you can find a version of the exercise with hints.
